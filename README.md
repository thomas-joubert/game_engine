# Something

Something is well... Something. An experiment on game engine making, mainly,
but also on game design and project architecture.

It is written in C++, using the SFML library and Cmake.

For the time being, its main features are :
* displaying squares on a screen
* moving one square around, without any collision

Installation :
* git clone https://github.com/thomas-joubert/game_engine.git
* cd game_engine
* mkdir build && cd build
* cmake ..
* make

The binaries will be generated in the _bin/_ directory.
